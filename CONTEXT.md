# Bomberman Learning Context

This context defines the project-specific language used to separate game legality, predicted survival, and learned action choice.

## Language

**Physical legal action**:
An action the current game state permits under collision, occupancy, bomb availability, and curriculum rules. Physical legality makes no claim about future survival.
_Avoid_: Valid move, safe move

**Horizon-survivable action**:
A physical legal action for which at least one continuation remains alive through the complete configured prediction horizon.
_Avoid_: Good action, optimal action

**Avoidable fatal action**:
A physical legal action that is not horizon-survivable in a state containing at least one horizon-survivable alternative.
_Avoid_: Bad move, unsafe action

**Survival mask**:
The subset of physical legal actions that are horizon-survivable. It is a veto boundary, not a ranking or recommendation among the remaining actions.
_Avoid_: Safety policy, rule-based controller

**Safety intervention**:
A decision where the learner's highest-valued physical legal action is vetoed by the survival mask and another learned action is selected.
_Avoid_: Rule action, corrected action

**No-safe-action fallback**:
A decision state with no horizon-survivable physical legal action, in which the learner selects its highest-valued physical legal action without a safety veto.
_Avoid_: Random fallback, rescue action
